# WryTest
Basic write test for drives and network paths in Windows. Built in CMD/Batch

Instructions are given as needed while the script runs. Make sure you include trailing slashes in file paths where prompted to do so!

Just be very careful to confirm that paths are what you want them to be. This script calls xcopy with a /Y switch.
